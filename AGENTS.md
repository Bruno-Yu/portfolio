# Spectra Instructions

This project uses Spectra for Spec-Driven Development(SDD). Specs live in `openspec/specs/`, change proposals in `openspec/changes/`.

## Use `$spectra-*` skills when:

- A discussion needs structure before coding → `$spectra-discuss`
- User wants to plan, propose, or design a change → `$spectra-propose`
- Tasks are ready to implement → `$spectra-apply`
- There's an in-progress change to continue → `$spectra-ingest`
- User asks about specs or how something works → `$spectra-ask`
- Implementation is done → `$spectra-archive`
- Commit only files related to a specific change → `$spectra-commit`

## Workflow

discuss? → propose → apply ⇄ ingest → archive

- `discuss` is optional — skip if requirements are clear
- Requirements change mid-work? `ingest` → resume `apply`

## Parked Changes

Changes can be parked（暫存）— temporarily moved out of `openspec/changes/`. Parked changes won't appear in `spectra list` but can be found with `spectra list --parked`. To restore: `spectra unpark <name>`. The `$spectra-apply` and `$spectra-ingest` skills handle parked changes automatically.

# OpenSpec Instructions

These instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.

Always use `/spectra:*` skills when the request:

- Mentions planning or proposals (words like proposal, spec, change, plan)
- Introduces new capabilities, breaking changes, architecture shifts, or big performance/security work
- Sounds ambiguous and you need the authoritative spec before coding

Quick reference:

- `/spectra:apply` - Implement tasks

Keep this managed block so 'openspec update' can refresh the instructions.
